Ideas and Selection Rationale
    Academic resource platform
    Features:
    - User accounts/profiles
    - Upload/download study materials
    - Calendar w assignment tracking
    Purpose:
    Help students to stay organized, share study materials and track assignments

Branching Strategy
    I will have a main branch, a feature branch where I add new features and a test branch where I actually develop new features and maek sure they work

Branch Usage Reflections

Django Setup
    The app name is meant to be just a placeholder but I am confused about what the startproject folder_name step was about
Virtual Environment Choices
    I don't understand what is meant by my choice of virtual environment

Assignment 3:
Why these models/fields?:
The main content of the site will be study materials and a calendar with due dates, so I figured I'd need those and their relationship to the user.
Your relationship choices:
Materials and assignments need to be deleted in the event the user is deleted because they belong strictly to the user
Constraints:
Email is unique because no 2 users should be using the same email
How you seeded test data:
I added a few random examples of what materialsa user might have and made a couple of example assignments
